# 🛍️ E-commerce Customer Segmentation & Personalized Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **cluster-based recommendation system** for e-commerce platforms that combines customer segmentation with personalized product recommendations. By grouping customers into meaningful segments using clustering algorithms and providing tailored recommendations within each segment, the system delivers highly relevant product suggestions that enhance user engagement and drive sales.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Develop an intelligent customer segmentation and personalization system that:
- Segments customers using clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) based on behavior, preferences, and demographics
- Provides personalized, content-based recommendations within each customer segment
- Offers a web-based interface for real-time interaction and visualization
- Handles large volumes of customer data with real-time processing capabilities

---

## 🚀 Features

- **⚡ Customer Segmentation**: Advanced clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
- **📊 Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA for cluster visualization and analysis
- **💡 Personalized Recommendations**: Content-based filtering per customer segment
- **🌐 Web Interface**: User registration, login, and interactive dashboard
- **💬 Real-time Processing**: Apache Kafka/Storm integration for live recommendations
- **🧩 Modular Architecture**: Scalable and maintainable code structure
- **✅ High Performance**: Evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
- **📈 Cluster Analysis**: Detailed pattern identification and trend analysis
